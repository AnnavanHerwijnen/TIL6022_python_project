# TIL6022_python_project
A repository containing the files for the group project for the TIL6022 course Python Programming.

This README explains how we safely work on this project using GitHub.  

---

## 1. Roles
- **Owner / Boss:** [@AnnavanHerwijnen]  
  - Only the owner can delete the repo or change important settings.  
- **Collaborators (everyone else):**  
  - Can edit files, save changes, and upload to GitHub.  
  - Cannot delete the project or change owner-level settings.

---

## 2. Basic Workflow 

1. **Pull** the latest version from GitHub before starting work.  
   - This ensures you have the newest files.  

2. **Work** on your Python files in your local project folder.  

3. **Commit** your changes (save a snapshot) with a short note describing what you did.  

4. **Push** your changes to GitHub so everyone else can see them.  

> On GitHub Desktop, these are just buttons:  
> - Pull = “Fetch origin / Pull”  
> - Commit = “Commit to main”  
> - Push = “Push origin”

---

## 3. Safety Rules
- Always **pull before pushing**.  
- Don’t delete the repo or folders.  
- Don’t rename files randomly.  
- If two people edit the same file at the same time, **tell the owner** to help resolve conflicts.  

---

## 4. Optional (for later, advanced use)
- Each person can create a **branch** for their feature.  
- Then make a **Pull Request** → owner checks and merges into main.  
- For now, it’s okay to commit directly to main if small and careful.
