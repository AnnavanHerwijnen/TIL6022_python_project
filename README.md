# TIL6022_python_project
A repository containing the files for the group project for the TIL6022 course Python Programming.

This README explains how we safely work on this project using GitHub.  

---

## 1. Roles
- **Owner / Boss:** [@AnnavanHerwijnen]  
  - Only the owner can delete the repo or change important settings.  
- **Collaborators (everyone else):**  
  - Can edit files, save changes, and upload to GitHub.  
  - Cannot delete the project or change owner-level settings.

## 2. Basic Workflow (Safe for Beginners)

### Step 1: Start
1. **Pull** the latest version from main before starting work.  
2. **Create your branch** for your task:  
   - Branch name example: `feature-login` or `data-cleaning`  
   - This keeps main safe and allows testing before merging.

### Step 2: Work
- Work on your Python files in your branch on your computer.  

### Step 3: Save & Upload
1. **Commit** your changes with a short note (like “Added analysis diagram”).  
2. **Push** your branch to GitHub.

### Step 4: Merge
- On GitHub, **create a Pull Request (PR)** from your branch to main.  
- The **someone checks** the code:  
  - If it works, merge into main.  
  - If it’s broken, PR stays open until fixed.  
- Main always stays **working and stable**.

## 3. Safety Rules
- **Never work directly on main.** Always create your own branch.  
- **Pull main before starting a new branch** to get the latest code.  
- Don’t delete files randomly or overwrite others’ branches.  
- Ask the owner for help if a conflict happens.

## 4. Tip for Beginners
- Using **GitHub Desktop** makes this very easy:  
  - Pull = “Fetch origin / Pull”  
  - Commit = “Commit to [branch name]”  
  - Push = “Push origin”  
  - Create PR on GitHub website
