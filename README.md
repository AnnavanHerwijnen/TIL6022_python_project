# TIL6022_python_project
A repository containing the files for the group project for the TIL6022 course Python Programming.


## Basic Workflow 

1. **Pull** the latest version from GitHub before starting work.  
   - This ensures you have the newest files.  

2. **Work** on your Python files in your local project folder.  

3. **Commit** your changes (save a snapshot) with a short note describing what you did.  

4. **Push** your changes to GitHub so everyone else can see them.  

> On GitHub Desktop, these are just buttons:  
> - Pull = “Fetch origin / Pull”  
> - Commit = “Commit to main”  
> - Push = “Push origin”
