This folder contains the data for the project.

There are 4 datasets available for this project:

KNMI data: 
CSV files for all weather stations in the Netherlands for the time 2020-2024.

Translink data:
CSV files for the number of daily check in for NS trains for the time 2020-2025.

OV-fiets data:
CSV files for data on the availability of NS rental bikes on each station throughout the day. 
This data is available from 2015-2024, but currently only one day in 2017 is added to the github, because of size of the files.

MPN data:
A dataset from the Dutch mobility panel, which runs from 2013-2022 
This dataset is restricted because of privacy reasons. 
It is therefore not added to this folder.
Access can be obtained by applying for it through the following website: https://english.kimnet.nl/the-netherlands-mobility-panel/access-to-mpn-data
