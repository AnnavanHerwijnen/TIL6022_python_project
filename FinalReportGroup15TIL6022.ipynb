    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, the daily habits of countless individuals are altered by the weather they encounter. Studies have shown that weather significantly affects mode choice; dry, calm, and moderately warm conditions encourage cycling, whereas adverse weather reduces cycling and increases public transport use (Böcker et al., 2016). Additionally, research on e-bike travel indicates that rain, wind, and snow reduce usage, while moderate temperatures have a positive effect, very high temperatures may decrease trips. Lastly, concerning public transport, adverse weather can increase travel time and affect user willingness (Sabir et al., 2010). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, most research focuses on a single mode or on local areas, with limited studies examining nationwide weather variations across several transport modes. As such, it can be said that it remains unclear how weather drives transport mode shifts at a national level in the Netherlands’ transport system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these dynamics is crucial for climate adaptation in the years to come. By gaining greater understanding on this topic, operators can optimise scheduling and resource use. Likewise, policymakers can design more resilient sustainable transport networks that account for such patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to examine the relationship between daily weather patterns and travel mode choice in the Netherlands from 2023 to 2024. This is done by means of the use of weather data (from KNMI), public transport ridership (Translink) and shared bike (OV Fiets) availability. By means of such data, an analysis has been conducted to evaluate how transport preferences within (and between) cycling and train ridership according to average temperature and rainfall levels. "

    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the research aim defined above, the following research question has been defined: \n",
    "\n",
    "***What is the correlation between daily transport (train and bicycle) usage and weather patterns (average temperature and precipitation) in urban areas in the Netherlands in 2023? ***\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to operationalise this research question within the context of the TIL6022 project, more manageable research sub-questions have been defined:\n",
    "-\tWhat is the correlation between train ridership and weather patterns (average temperature and precipitation)? \n",
    "-\tWhat is the correlation between shared bicycle (OV Fiets) usage and weather patterns (average temperature and precipitation)? \n",
    "-\tHow does train ridership shift with changes in weather conditions (average temperature and precipitation)?\n",
    "-\tHow does shared bicycle usage shift with changes in weather conditions (average temperature and precipitation)? \n",
    "- How does the difference caused by different weather conditions compare between train ridership and shared bicycle usage? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the weather patterns that can be analysed are dependent on data availability. This is particularly important with respect to location-specific weather patterns, such as wind or precipitation levels. \n",

    "Based on the Research Questions and Sub-Questions formulated, numerous possible databases were explored and evaluated for possible use. Of these databases found, three were subsequently used; that is, the KNMI Weather Database, the Translink Public Transport Dataset, and the OV Fiets Availability Database. These databases have been further detailed below: \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut (KNMI, or the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute) Weather Dataset: \n",
    "Firstly, the KNMI dataset provides comprehensive meteorological observations collected from multiple weather stations distributed throughout the Netherlands. It includes parameters such as daily minimum and maximum temperature, wind speed, wind gusts, sunshine duration, and precipitation duration. Each station’s geographic coordinates enable spatial linking with nearby public transport stations. The historical data spans from 1991 to 2025, ensuring a robust temporal coverage. From the wide range of data available, only a few of these were found to be sufficiently available at a geographical level to allow for subsequent analysis. "

It represents total check-ins from the OV-chipkaart system (before 2023) and both OV-chipkaart and OVpay systems (from 2023 onwards). The dataset provides nationwide coverage from 2020 to 2024, reflecting variations in public transport demand across different weather conditions.

    "## Research Gap and Hypothesis Formulation \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the research question posed, it is now important to briefly explore the prior art. This serves a dual purpose, on the one hand, to find what the current project can contribute to. On the other hand, this process helps identify what relations could be expected between the different variables. This will be done by exploring outcomes reached by prior research and subsequently complemented by a newly formulated hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was found that prior research had already been conducted in the desired geographical context. Namely, investigations by Böcker et al. (2019) and Wilkesmann et al. (2023) were conducted within the desired geographical context and focused on the effect of weather on mobility patterns – with Böcker et al. (2019) analysing the effect of weather on mode choice and Wilkesmann et al. (2023) evaluates possible “temporal and weather-related determinants” associated to the use of OV Fiets. Beyond this, research by Galich and Nieland (2023) was also found to be insightful, covering the effect of weather conditions on the transportation mode used in Germany.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the research identified, the key research gap found is related to the analyses conducted with seasonal data and more detailed analyses with different weather phenomena such as wind, precipitation or fog. Therefore, efforts will be made to assess the feasibility of conducting such research with the data available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, regarding the hypothesis formulation concerning the effect of weather on transport mode selection,  the research by the papers mentioned attribute a varying degree of significance to the effect weather has on transportation mode selection. For instance, Galich and Nieland (2023) characterise this effect as marginal – most notably concluding that these impacts tend to be smaller in densely-populated urban metropolis – while Böcker et al. (2019) find considerable regional differences in this effect. Lastly, Wilkesmann et al. (2023) state that no clear set of variables were found that were able to explain variance across the entire set of stations. Due to the differences in findings amongst the papers mentioned, it was not possible to create a hypothesis linked to the general trend of research. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, a new hypothesis has been formulated:\n",
    "> It is expected that, accounting for the time and scope constraints of the project, a tenuous effect will be observed with respect to weather altering transportation patterns of users of the Dutch mobility system. Specifically, it is expected that as weather conditions get more extreme – that is, with respect to wind, rain, fog and temperature – the percentage of bicycles used decreases.\n"

    "## Geographical and Temporal Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "Having identified the research gap and formulated a hypothesis of the expected results, it is important to go into further detail about the intended geographical and temporal scale of the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, regarding the geographical scale, this has been set at the national level for the Netherlands (overseas territories notwithstanding). This was done with the aim of observing transport patterns across the same transport system with as much weather variety as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the temporal scale was determined by ideating the scope of the project. This is important to mention as data was obtained for a long period of time. Most notably, this caused issues with respect to the analysis of data obtained from the OV Fiets availability database due to the sheer number of OV Fiets station locations. As such, the temporal scale was set to be for the year 2023. \n",

    "## Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The OV-fiets datasets for 2023 and 2024 were obtained from the Onofficieel Archief Reisinformatie Nederlands Openbaar Vervoer (rijdendetreinen.nl) open data portal. After downloading, the files were saved locally and preprocessed to retain only the relevant variables — namely, the timestamp of the log, the station name, and the number of bicycles available. All other columns were removed to ensure consistency and reduce data complexity. The cleaned data were then converted into a Parquet file format, a binary, compressed structure that allows efficient storage and faster processing. <br> <br>\n",
    "Subsequently, daily totals of rented bicycles were calculated for each station by analysing variations in bike availability throughout the day. This enabled the estimation of the sum of daily bikes rented per day and per station. Finally, weekly averages were computed from the daily totals to identify broader temporal trends in OV-fiets usage. <br> <br>\n",
    "2. The KNMI (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut) dataset used in this study covers the period 2023–2024. The dataset includes meteorological observations collected from multiple weather stations across the Netherlands. From the available parameters, only the necessary columns such as temperature, precipitation, and weather station identifiers were retained. The data, originally recorded at hourly intervals (24 values per day), were processed to derive daily and weekly summaries. <br> <br>\n",
    "For each weather station, the maximum temperature of each day was determined based on the hourly readings. These daily maximum temperatures were then aggregated to compute the average of maximum daily temperatures per week for each station. This preprocessing enabled the alignment of the weather dataset’s temporal resolution with that of the transport datasets, facilitating meaningful correlation analysis between weather conditions and travel behaviour. <br> <br>\n",
    "3. For the TransLink dataset, only the essential columns were retained to focus the analysis on public transport usage patterns. Specifically, the dataset was filtered to include check-in counts, timestamp (time of check-in), and date and hour information. "

    "### OV-Fiets Bike Rental Data and KNMI Weather Station Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The code processes OV-bike rental data and KNMI weather station data in the Netherlands to link each rental station to its nearest weather station. It starts by reading the processed Parquet file containing bike rental information for a specific day. It then reads the weather station dataset, which includes the locations of all KNMI stations. Using Plotly, it visualizes both datasets on an interactive map, with blue dots representing OV-fiets stations and red dots representing weather stations. For each rental station, the code calculates the geodesic distance to all weather stations, identifies the closest one, and records this information along with the distance in a new dataframe. The result is a mapping of each bike rental station to its nearest weather station, such as Delft’s station being 7.9 km from Rotterdam, enabling further analyses like studying the impact of weather on bike rentals. \n",
